With this, through a loop and several algorithms that are nowadays quite optimized, it was possible to create a quite acceptable behavior that is controlled from the same space. ",

With this I managed to create a triangular communication vehicle with which we optimised the handling of all the information, objects, and functions that were used or found in each level.",

As we started doing the project, I started to see and understand the different mechanics of this type of game and especially how their levels work. I have always liked to know how the levels work and what tools are used to make players go where the designers want them to go or see, and understand what they have thought, in this project I have been able to see that this work is very complicated and that it is necessary to iterate many times to end up with a fun and functional level.

During the middle of the project, we needed some help in art, so I switched to the Art department to help.\nWhen I was in art, I helped with the animations, but mainly I focused on level 2. I did some props, all of the houses and the city wall. Lastly, I put it all together and made the final touches to the 2nd level.\nIn the final milestones I helped in the gameplay feedback and polish of the game. It was a lot of fun and helped me decide that I want to become either a Level Designer or a 3D Environment artist.",

In total, I managed to get 35k of polys, with a total of 84 houses (just 13 of these are different models). I scaled, rotated, added and removed props so any of the houses feel repetitive. By far, the thing I'm most proud of during this project.",
